# Data Analysis and Results for HCI20 Conference Submission Paper

This work summarizes and analyzes the results of an experiment conducted for the HCI Internation 2020 Conference.  The paper is called Why Did the Robot Cross the Road? A User Study of Explanation in Human-Robot Interactionand will be published by Springer in HCI International 2020 - Late Breaking Papers: Multimodality and Intelligence (Volume 12424 of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series).  Here is the abstract from the paper:
This work documents a pilot user study evaluating the effectiveness of contrastive, causal and example explanations in supporting human understanding of AI in a hypothetical commonplace human-robot interaction (HRI) scenario. In doing so, this work situates “explainable AI” (XAI) in the context of the social sciences and suggests that HRI explanations are improved when informed by the social sciences.
